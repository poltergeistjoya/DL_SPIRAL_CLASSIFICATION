# DL_SPIRAL_CLASSIFICATION

This project implements a sequential deep learning model to find the boundaries between two different classes. Specifically by implementing a multilayer perceptron, training data of two different spirals are passed in to find class boundaries.


Although not implemented here, the trained model can then be used to classify points to either of the spirals based on coordinates.
